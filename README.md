Heey beautiful campers from Batch 966! 🤓

Here you can find all the lectures and livecodes from our classes together!

Remember, you don't need to keep navegation through this folders on github. You can instead:

simply press the `.` key on your keyboard to open a VS Code enviroment in your browser with the code clone the repo in you terminal running `git clone git@github.com:lucasevero/batch-966.git`.

If you don't want to lose the updates of the repo you can star it; ⭐

Or just keep running `git pull origin master` in your cloned directory after classes so you can fetch new code 😉
